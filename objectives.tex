\chapter{Objectives of the project}

The objective of this project is to increase the functionality of \emph{gedit}, 
by adding new features and by porting these changes to the new libraries marked 
as a requirement, which are to be part of \GNOME 3.0.   These changes require 
considerable software development changes and form the main part of work associated 
with this project.  Apart from the coding effort, conformity must be maintained 
with the development community.


As such, this project has had its own external technical exigencies, as well 
as time-pressures associated with an active open-source project subject to 
peer review and criticism.  Thus, an implicit objective of this project has 
been to demonstrate the creation of high quality software, while taking great 
technical risks associated with the use of forward looking and state of the art 
libraries, in order to project the application into the future.   This aspect 
of the project is best understood by describing in more detail changes 
associated with libraries and features sought.


Also, it should be noted that each of these changes were part of the development 
of this project, carried out by the author, and do not represent contributions 
by other developers.   This has been a considerable challenge, and some effort 
in the documentation has been devoted to portraying different tribulations of this
process.
