\chapter{Invalid characters}

\addfigure[width=\textwidth]{./images/gedit-encoding-error}{Encoding error}{fig:GeditEncodingError}

As it can be seen in the figure \ref{fig:GeditEncodingError}, when an user loads a document, if this document contains any invalid character, the character will be escaped and shown with a red color. An error is shown allowing to do:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reopen the document with a different encoding. For this the user has to select a different encoding in the drop down menu and press the \emph{Retry} button.
  \item Edit the document. For this it has to be pressed the button \emph{Edit Anyway}. The problem of doing this is that the document can be corrupted if the user is not careful enough.
  \item Read the document without editing it. For this the user can press the button \emph{Close}. This will close the error message and it will not allow to modify anything in the document.
\end{itemize}
