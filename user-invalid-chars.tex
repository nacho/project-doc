\chapter{Invalid characters}

\addfigure[width=\textwidth]{./images/gedit-encoding-error}{Encoding error}{fig:GeditEncodingError}

As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:GeditEncodingError}, when a user loads a document and this document 
contains any invalid character, the character will be flagged and shown with a red color. Also, an error is shown allowing the user to do the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reopen the document with a different encoding. For this the user has to select a different encoding in the drop down menu and press the \emph{Retry} button.
  \item Edit the document. For this, the button \emph{Edit Anyway} must be pressed. The problem with doing this is that the document can be corrupted if the user is not careful enough.
  \item Read the document without editing it. For this, the user can press the \emph{Close} button. This will close the error message and it will not allow to modify anything in the document.
\end{itemize}
