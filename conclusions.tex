\section{About the developed product}

gedit 3.0 is a good product. Although it involved an arduous development cycle, with some development delays,  
a solid program was released, even though it was forseen that the \GNOME 3.0 initial target release date wa not attainable.


*** should put some conclusions here about the contributions that you made  *****



\section{About the development cycle}



Something that can be learned from this project, is that working under stress is very difficult. It requires that all the libraries are compiled, 
kept up to dated, updated to the last API changes from these libraries every day so as not to upset other developers, and 
modify previous designs due to the fact that the library has changed.

In my opinion, working under such stress with such a small group of people is not worthwhile.   I have to admit, that doing it helped a lot to the GTK+ and GLib team to have a better code base. But it was too complicated for us. This shows that sometimes it is better to delay some features in order to have more tested and better approached programming. In the appendix \ref{GNOME3AppDevs} an overview about this is pointed out.

\section{About the working process}

The working process is not good at all, it misses directions from the first time. The way everybody works in this product is `too free', but the point is that it works. The project has been evolving during the last 10 years, so it is remarkable that not really following an specific methodology, not having specific plans, but knowing that you have 6 months to add new features to the program and from this point you have to decide if it is worth making it or not, it works and it provides a good product.

\section{About the personal experience}

gedit is one of the most important text editor in the current times. It is the main text editor by default of the \GNOME desktop. 
Being part of it, is an incredible personal achievement.

Also not only about the gedit, but the community around it. The fact that you are working with such a lot of experts, learning so 
much from them, it is a undeniable experience.




*** NOTE: I suggest that if you want to put this section, list some specific ways in which this 
type of programming has helped.... Your statements are too vague..
