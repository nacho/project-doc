\chapter{Drag and Drop of Tabs}

%FIXME first draft

\section{Analysis and design}

As said in the previous chapter, a \emph{modification} in the drag and drop system had to be made. gedit's custom drag and drop was implemented a few years ago, when GtkNotebook did not have a way to do it by itself. This was implemented in GTK+ since the version 2.12, but it had a problem holding the port of gedit, it did not allow to drag a tab out of the window to create a new window with this tab attached to it.
