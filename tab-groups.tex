\chapter{Tab Groups}

\section{Analysis}

gedit is currently using a multiple document interface, called \emph{MDI}. By the use of tabs it provides a way to visualize several documents in a single window. With the current interface gedit has the problem that it can not show different documents at the same time, the only way right now, it is to open two gedit windows and resize them to fit the screen. This is very tedious and uncomfortable for the user.

\subsection{Questions}

Knowing this problem, when brainstorming in the different possibilities about implementing this, the next questions showed up:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How do we show the extra document to the user? Different tab groups or inside a tab?
  \item How do we want to allow the split? Vertically, Horizontally or allow both?
  \item How many side documents should we allow?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Do not reinvent the wheel}

When analyzing a problem, the gedit team has something very clear, check what are doing the other competitors, analyze their ideas and decide which one could fit better our requisites. Before answering the questions the programs below have been checked:

\subsubsection{Netbeans}

In the figure \ref{fig:NetbeansScreenshot} it can be shown that this program allows to have several tab groups\footnote{By tab groups we refer to the ability of grouping tabs in different groups that can be viewed at the same time in a window} and group them either horizontally and vertically. This is due to the fact that netbeans uses a docking system which allows it to place the tabs whichever the user prefer. In GTK+ there is not any widget or way to provide this ability, there is another library called \emph{GDL} that provides this and it is used by programs like anjuta, but it has the problem that it is not very well maintained and it would produce problems in the future.

\subsubsection{Kate}

In relation to kate as shown in the figure \ref{fig:KateScreenshot}, we can see that it does not have proper tabs as in gedit, it has a side pane showing the documents and it allows to open the documents either vertically or horizontally. This solution escapes from the sense of gedit and in our opinion can make things not very discoverable for the end-up user.

\subsubsection{Notepad++}

In the figure \ref{fig:NotepadScreenshot} we can see that it has a similar interface to the one in gedit. It allows to create only one more tab group and it only makes an horizontally split.

\subsection{Answering to the questions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Tab groups fit better the current gedit design and it will make it easier to use for the user and easier to implement.
  \item Horizontal split makes sense for visualizing documents side by side. Vertical split makes more sense if you are editing the same document in different parts of it. I.e having splitted the document to edit and show several parts of it.
  \item It was decided to allow n splits. It is up to the user to decide how many splits he wants. If at some point is needed to put some restriction, it would be easier to make it.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Design}

\subsection{Prototyping}

In the figure \ref{fig:TabGroupsProto1} it can be shown a prototype made with glade in relation how it would look and what kind of widgets will be used. In the figure \ref{fig:TabGroupsProto2} it has been made a prototype also that helped to answer the questions above, showing the vertical split. Apart from the visual design some points must be taken into account:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item By default a gedit window has a single tab group (current behavior).
  \item The same document can NOT appear in different tab groups or different tabs.
\end{enumerate}

    \caption{Tab groups prototype 2}\label{fig:TabGroupsProto2}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\subsection{User interface}

To interact with tab groups, it was decided to provide three new menu items in the \emph{Documents} menu.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{New Tab Group:} It creates a tab group in the right of the focused one, and it adds a new tab to it.
  \item \textbf{Previous Tab Group:} Moves the focus to the previous (left) tab group.
  \item \textbf{Next Tab Group:} Moves the focus to the next (right) tab group.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Class diagram modification}

\addfigure[scale=0.45]{./images/tab-groups-diagram}{Tab groups diagram}{fig:TabGroupDiagram}

As it can be visualized in the figure \ref{fig:TabGroupDiagram} a new class has been introduced, \emph{GeditMultiNotebook}. This class will take care of create and remove GeditNotebooks, proxying the signals emittion for page-added, page-removed and switch-page and it will be kept as an implementation detail where the user will not have direct access to its API.

\newpage
\subsection{GeditMultiNotebook}

This class works as a proxy to \emph{GeditNotebook}, most of the API and signals are the same, here will be explained the different methods and signals.

\subsubsection{Signals}

GTK+ provides a widget called \emph{GtkHPaned}, which is a container with two children arranged horizontally. An intensive use of this widget is needed in order to arrange the tab groups side by side.

The next pseudocode shows how it must be implemented:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=GObject]

void
add_notebook(new_notebook, main_container)
{
	if (main_container)
		main_container(new_notebook)
	else {
		paned = new_paned()
		parent = active_notebook.get_parent()
		parent.remove(active_notebook)
		parent.add(paned)

		paned.add1(active_notebook)
		paned.add2(new_notebook)
	}
	/* keep track of it in a list */
	notebooks.append(new_notebook)

	emit(notebook-added)
}

void
remove_notebook (notebook)
{
	if (notebooks.next() != NULL)
	{
		warning("Removing main notebook is not possible)
		return
	}

	ref(notebook)
	notebook.destroy()

	next = notebooks.next()
	parent = notebook.parent()
	children = parent.get_children()
	if (!children.next())
	{
		warning("parent must be a GtkPaned")
		return
	}

	grandpa = parent.parent()
	parent.remove(children[0])
	parent.destroy()
	grandpa.add(children[0])
	emit (notebook-removed, notebook)
	unref(notebook)
	focus(next)
}

\end{lstlisting}

\newpage
\section{Implementation}

To implemented this, there was one thing depending directly on GeditNotebook. \emph{GeditDocumentsPanel} (see figure \ref{fig:GeditDocumentsPanel1}), which shows in the side panel the currently opened documents and allows to manage them. This feature was disabled in order to be able to start the implementation.
