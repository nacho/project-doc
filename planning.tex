\section{Pre-project estimation}

In the pre-project document it was planned in the next way\footnote{See that the phase the documentation and development are made in parallel and that is the reason only 13 weeks are taken into account}:

\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabularx}{0.60\textwidth}{|X|X|}
      \firsthline
      \textbf{Phase:} & \textbf{Temporal estimation (in weeks):} \\
      \hline
      Initial phase & 3 \\
      \hline
      Development phase & 13 \\
      \hline
      Documentation phase & 13 \\
      \hline
      Final phase & 4 \\
      \hline
      \textbf{Total} & 23 \\
      \lasthline
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{Pre-project estimation}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Real estimation}

The planning of the duration of the project does not correspond with the real duration, because of the next points:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \GNOME release was delayed, as gnome-shell was not prepared on time and it was decided to improve more GTK+ 3.
  \item The realization of the Erasmus produce part of this delay.
\end{itemize}

In the next charts it is shown the real estimation of the planning of the project:

\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabularx}{0.60\textwidth}{|X|X|}
      \firsthline
      \textbf{Phase:} & \textbf{Temporal estimation (in weeks):} \\
      \hline
      Initial phase & 4 \\
      \hline
      Development phase & 18 \\
      \hline
      Documentation phase & 18 \\
      \hline
      Final phase & 6 \\
      \hline
      \textbf{Total} & 25 \\
      \lasthline
    \end{tabularx}
