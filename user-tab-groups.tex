\chapter{Tab groups}

One of the main points for any \GNOME application is to provide an easy to use user interface. To manage the tab groups three menu items were provided, as shown in the figure \ref{fig:DocumentsMenu}. Below you can find a explanation of each menu item in detail:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{New Tab Group:} It creates a new tab group in the right side of the active document, with a new document on it.
  \item \textbf{Previous Tab Group:} Moves the focus to the tab group on the left. If there is no tab group on the left it moves the focus to the last tab group.
  \item \textbf{Next Tab Group:} Moves the focus to the tab group on the right. If there is no tab group on the right it moves the focus to the first tab group.
\end{itemize}

In the figure \ref{fig:UserTabGroups}, it can be visualized an example of how it would look a gedit window with two tab groups and several docuements opened on each of them.
