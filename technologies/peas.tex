libpeas is a gobject-based plugins engine, and is targeted at giving every application the chance to assume its own extensibility. It is currently used by several GNOME applications like gedit and Totem.

It takes its roots in the old \emph{gedit plugins engine}, and provides an extensive set of features mirroring the desiderata of most of the applications providing an extension framework.
