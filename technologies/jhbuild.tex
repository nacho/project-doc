\section[JHBuild]{JHBuild\footnote{\url{http://git.gnome.org/browse/jhbuild/tree/README}}}\label{jhbuild}

JHBuild is a tool designed to ease building collections of source packages, called \emph{modules}.

JHBuild was originally written for building GNOME, but has since been extended to be usable with other projects.

An extensive use of this tool has been done. It was needed, to be able to build \emph{gedit} and \emph{gtksourceview} with the upstream versions of the libraries (see \ref{Gtk} and \ref{GLib}).
