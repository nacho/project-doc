\section[GObject-Introspection]{GObject-Introspection\cite{website:introspection}}\label{sec:g-i}

The introspection project has two major goals, and a variety of more minor ones.

\subsection{Two level applications - C and \emph{your favorite runtime}}

It makes sense to build many kinds of applications using (at least) two different levels of languages. Those being \emph{C + GObject}, and a managed (GC'd) \emph{runtime}. C is good for graphics, multimedia, and lower level systems work. However, writing complex software is difficult and error-prone without garbage collection.

\subsection{Making the platform even more binding-friendly}

The introspection project solves this by putting all of the metadata inside the GObject library itself, using annotations in the comments. This will lead to less duplicate work from binding authors, and a more reliable experience for binding consumers.
