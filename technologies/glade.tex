\section[Glade]{Glade\cite{website:glade}}\label{sec:Glade}

Glade is a RAD\footnote{Rapid application development.} tool to enable quick and easy development of user interfaces for the GTK+ toolkit and the \GNOME desktop environment. The user interfaces designed in Glade are stored in XML format, enabling easy integration with external tools.

Glade is used in \emph{gedit} mainly to create static interfaces, such as dialogs or panels, that are not changing during the live of the running application.
