\section{Configure the search pop up}

As we can see in the figure \ref{fig:SearchPopupMenu}, when we search for some text we can select some options to restrict the search. By default the less restrictive search will be provided. To launch the drop down menu it has to be clicked in the lens icon, either with the left or right button of the mouse. Below there is an explanation of each item in the dropdown menu:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Match Case:} It will make the search case sensitive.
  \item \textbf{Match Entire Word Only:} It will only match whole words.
  \item \textbf{Wrap Around:} This option will make the search engine to start from the beginning once the end of the document is reached.
\end{itemize}

\section{Match visualizing}

When doing the interactive search there are two visual reports. The active match and the matches around the document. The active match it is the selected text found where the cursor is placed. The matches found in the document are visualized in a different color depending on the theme and it shows all the occurrences for the searched text in the document.
